## What is a Linked List?

A Linked List is a fundamental data structure which functions very similar to the Python List. The benefit of a linked list is that the elements can easily be inserted or removed without reallocation of any other elements.

This project uses a simple linked list, meaning each element is only aware of the data it holds, and the element that comes `next`.

_Linked Lists are not really necessary in Python. This Project is only meant for practice!_
